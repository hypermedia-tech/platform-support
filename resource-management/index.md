# Resource Management

This section provides guidance on effectively managing Kubernetes resources, understanding common issues, and implementing best practices to maintain a healthy cluster.

## Overview

Kubernetes resource management involves creating, updating, monitoring, and deleting various objects within your cluster. Effective resource management is crucial for maintaining cluster health, optimizing performance, and ensuring application reliability.

## Key Topics

### Working with Finalizers

The [Finalizers](./finalizers.md) guide covers:

- Understanding how Kubernetes finalizers work
- Identifying resources with finalizers
- Safely removing finalizers when necessary
- Best practices for working with finalizers

Learn more in our [detailed finalizers guide](./finalizers.md).

### Common Resource Issues

The [Common Issues](./common-issues.md) guide covers:

- Troubleshooting stuck pods and deployments
- Resolving service and networking problems
- Fixing storage and volume issues
- Managing ConfigMaps and Secrets effectively

Refer to our [common issues guide](./common-issues.md) when facing resource-related challenges.

## Common Commands

Here are some frequently used commands for resource management:

```bash
# Get all resources in a namespace
kubectl get all -n <namespace>

# Delete resources with no graceful deletion
kubectl delete <resource-type> <resource-name> -n <namespace> --force --grace-period=0

# Scale a deployment
kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> -n <namespace> --replicas=<count>

# Edit a resource
kubectl edit <resource-type> <resource-name> -n <namespace>

# Describe resource for event and status info
kubectl describe <resource-type> <resource-name> -n <namespace>
```

## Resource Types and Relationships

Understanding how resources relate to each other helps in effective management:

- **Workload Resources**: Deployments manage ReplicaSets, which manage Pods
- **Service Resources**: Services, Endpoints, and Ingresses work together for networking
- **Config Resources**: ConfigMaps and Secrets provide configuration to Pods
- **Storage Resources**: StorageClasses, PersistentVolumes, and PersistentVolumeClaims form the storage system

## Best Practices

### Resource Organization

1. **Use Namespaces**: Logically separate resources by team, environment, or application
2. **Apply Labels**: Label resources for easier filtering and management
3. **Set Resource Requests/Limits**: Always specify CPU and memory requirements
4. **Use Deployments**: Prefer Deployments over bare Pods for better management

### Resource Health Monitoring

1. **Regular Auditing**: Periodically check for unused or abandoned resources
2. **Resource Metrics**: Use metrics-server and monitoring tools like Prometheus
3. **Set Resource Quotas**: Apply quotas at the namespace level to prevent resource exhaustion
4. **Configure Liveness/Readiness Probes**: Add appropriate health checks to your applications

### Cleanup Strategies

1. **Garbage Collection**: Understand and use Kubernetes garbage collection
2. **Owner References**: Ensure proper resource ownership for automatic cleanup
3. **Resource Pruning**: Regularly remove completed Jobs and failed Pods
4. **Namespace Lifecycle**: Implement policies for namespace creation and deletion

## Resource Management Tools

Beyond kubectl, consider these tools for enhanced resource management:

- **Kustomize**: For managing resource configurations
- **Helm**: For packaging and deploying applications
- **kubectl-plugins**: Extensions like `kubectl neat` and `kubectl resource-capacity`
- **K9s**: Terminal-based UI for resource management
